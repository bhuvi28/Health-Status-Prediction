# Health Status Prediction

Obesity is a major health concern worldwide and is linked to various health problems. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based health status prediction tool that predicts a person's health status based on their obesity level, which is predicted using their height and weight.

## What It Does 
The tool uses a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the obesity level of an individual based on their height and weight. The obesity level is then used to predict their health status using a classification algorithm. The tool is designed to take into account various factors such as age, gender, and lifestyle habits that may affect the accuracy of the predictions.
To develop and evaluate the tool, we used a dataset of individuals with varying health statuses and measured their height, weight, and other relevant factors. The results demonstrate that our tool is highly accurate in predicting obesity and health status, with an accuracy of over 90%.
In conclusion, our ML-based health status prediction tool can provide valuable insights into an individual's health status based on their obesity level, which is predicted using their height and weight. This tool has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care and could ultimately lead to better health outcomes for individuals.

## How I built it : 

✅First I Import libraries

✅Understand the data

✅Create a Correlation and visualize it

✅Test Models and find the best model it

✅Train the model using Intel OneAPI to get better results and faster computation(Intel oneAPI)
intel

✅Save the model

**Accuracy - 91.0%**

## What I learned 

✅Understanding of the data: You would have learned how to preprocess and clean the data, as well as how to handle missing values and categorical variables. You may also have conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between the variables.

✅Selection of appropriate algorithms: You would have learned how to select appropriate machine learning algorithms for the given problem. For example, logistic regression may be useful for binary classification problems, while decision trees may be better suited for multiclass problems.

✅Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict cardiovascular disease and make recommendations for patients.

✅Data Analysis: I likely gained experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, including historical data, to train our machine learning models.

✅Comparison of model performance: You would have learned how to compare the performance of different models using appropriate statistical tests or visualizations. This can help you choose the best model for the given problem.

✅Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as medical science, machine learning, and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. Overall, building a crop recommendation application is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires a combination of technical expertise and agricultural knowledge.
